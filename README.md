# IBM_Data_Capstone
In this capstone we completed a lot of labs related to data analysis and visualization. In order to analyse the Falcon 9 data and determine if the Falcon 9 first stage would successfully land, we gathered data using a RESTful API and web scraping. 
The data was also transformed into a dataframe, and after that, some data wrangling was done. Later, using Plotly Dash and Folium, we created a dashboard to interactively evaluate launch records and a map to assess the closeness of launch sites. 
Lastly, by comparing the performance of Hyperparameter for SVM, Classifier Trees, and Logistic Regression, we utilised machine learning to predict whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 will safely land.
The conclusion was that the most effective method for this dataset is the decision tree model. Lower payload mass rockets perform better than higher payload mass launches. 
The majority of launch locations are near to the equator, and every site is within a short distance of the shore. With time, launches have a higher success percentage. Among all the launch locations, KSC LC-39A has the best success rate. 
The success rate for the ES-L1, GEO, HEO, and SSO orbits is 100%.
